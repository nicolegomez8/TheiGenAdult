            <p>Sommelier is an elegant euphemism for professional wino. Fruity flavors, with aromas of rose petals, peaches, and allspice. Burgundy is the definition of a strong red. Red wine was associated with blood by the ancient Egyptians. Boxes, while repugnant, hold viable vinos. The first stage of wine tasting is looking over the appearance of the wine.<br><br>Sulfites are found in nearly all wines, produced by the yeast during fermentation. A bouquet becomes more complex and nuanced as the wine ages. Red wines usually trump whites in alcohol content. Winemakers refer to screw caps as Stelvin enclosures, because it sounds better than "lid." Throughout history, wine has been consumed for its intoxicating effects.<br><br>The Bordeaux wine region accounts for more than sixty percent of the cabernet sauvignon grown in France. Beaujolais, from the region that is its namesake, is made from Gamay grapes. <br><br>During racking, a wine is moved to a new barrel and separated from sediment in the old one. Don't be shy: wine experts stick their nose deep into the glass in order to pick up the complex nuances. Shiraz, Syrah, what's the difference? There is none. So many organic compounds are in wine. A botrytized wine is made using grapes that have been allowed to become mouldy. A big body makes an impression on the palate. In order to increase the alcohol content of their wines, some vintners began adding sugar to the grape must in a process called chaptalization.<br><br>Sangiovese – go ahead, pronounce it. Chinon is a town in France renowned for its winemaking. Bouquet refers to wine's aroma.<br><br>In cooler climates, cabernet sauvignon tends to produce wines with blackcurrant notes that can be accompanied by green bell pepper notes, mint and cedar which will all become more pronounced as the wine ages. Wines that are named for a region are always capitalized – Bordeaux, Burgundy, Champagne, Rioja, Chianti, Lambrusco, etc.<br><br>Hint: Sangiovese is a four syllable word. Maybe more if you're drunk. Take a sip of wine and hold it in your mouth for a few seconds, then either swallow it or spit out. Acidity is a naturally occurring component of every wine. Amaron is made primarily from Corvina grapes dried on racks before pressing. Grand Cru wines are produced from the small number of the best vineyard sites in the Côte d'Or.<br><br>In the unreliable summers of northern France, the acidity of under ripened grapes was often masked with chaptalization with unsatisfactory results, whereas now the less ripe grapes are made into popular sparkling wines. The aftertaste, or "finish," is the primary factor in judging the quality and character of wine. Acid, tannin, fruitiness, oakiness, are all components of balance. The world's oldest bottle of wine is over 1600 years old and can be found at a museum in Germany.<br><br>A grape in the glass is worth two on the vine. Decantering opens the wine through aeration, allowing the wine to display its full range.<br><br>When Cabernet Sauvignon is paired with steak or dishes with a heavy butter cream sauce, the tannins are neutralized, allowing the fruits of the wine to be more noticeable. A lingering finish indicates a luscious vintage! The term meritage is a blend of merit and heritage, and usually describes blended California wines. Vatican City is the smallest country in the world, but it consumes the most wine per capita worldwide. Sparkling reds include Lambrusco, from Italy, and Brachetto D'Acqui. Young red wines may require several hours to aerate – if there's still any left. </p>
